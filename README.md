This repository reproduces an analysis of a multi-site study of the effects of precipitation change on aquatic invertebrate communities. Using the community of animals found within bromeliad plants, we conducted manipulations of rainfall amount and variation (figure above) in seven sites throughout the Neotropics.

This repository contains only one of several manuscripts associated with this project. Data for this experiment is located [in a separate repository](https://github.com/SrivastavaLab/00_BWGrainfall_data)
